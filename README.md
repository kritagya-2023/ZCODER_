# 🚀 ZCODER – MERN Stack Project

ZCODER is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to interact with a coding platform interface and can be extended for features like coding contests, submission evaluations, or learning modules.

## 📦 Tech Stack
MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

After cloning the repository using `git clone https://github.com/kritagya-2023/ZCODER_.git`, move into the main project folder using `cd ZCODER_` and run `npm install` to install the root dependencies. Then move to the backend folder using `cd backend` and run `npm install` to install backend dependencies. Next, move to the frontend folder using `cd ../frontend` and run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies. To start the project, first run `node server.js` inside the backend folder to start the backend server, and then run `npm start` inside the frontend folder to start the React client. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or properly configured in your backend. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.
